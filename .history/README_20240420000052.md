# ROSE: Covisibility Region Aware 3D-LiDAR SLAM Based on Generative Road Surface Model 
---
**ROSE** aims to improve the vertical localization performance of LiDAR SLAM without the need of any additional sensors and 

The relevant paper has been submitted to IEEE T-AES and is under review now. 

Codes will come soon after the paper acceptance!
