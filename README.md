# ROSE: Covisibility Region Aware 3D-LiDAR SLAM Based on Generative Road Surface Model 
---
**ROSE** aims to improve the **vertical localization performance** of LiDAR-based SLAM in **generalizaed terrain conditions!** 

### Features:
* Without the need of any additional sensors.
* Without the assumption that the ground is absolute flat. 

The relevant paper has been submitted to IEEE T-AES and is under review now. 

Codes will come soon after the paper acceptance. 

Many thanks for the excellent works [LeGO-LOAM](https://github.com/RobustFieldAutonomyLab/LeGO-LOAM) and [Faster-LIO](https://github.com/gaoxiang12/faster-lio).
